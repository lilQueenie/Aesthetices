<h3>Being Aesthetic</h3>
<p>Color Palette: Choose a cohesive color scheme for your outfits, social media posts, or living space. Stick to a few key colors that complement each other.

<br><br>
Consistent Theme: Maintain a consistent theme or mood in your content or surroundings. This could be minimalist, vintage, modern, or any other style that resonates with you.
<br><br>
Composition and Symmetry: Pay attention to how elements are arranged. Clean lines and balanced compositions contribute to a more aesthetically pleasing look.
<br><br>
Quality Photography: Whether it's for your Instagram feed or personal collections, use high-quality and well-composed photographs. Good lighting and framing make a significant difference.</p>

<h3>What Style!</h3>
<p>Mindful Fashion Choices: Build a wardrobe with pieces that match your aesthetic. Pay attention to the details, such as fabric, patterns, and silhouettes.
<br><br>
Typography and Design: If you're creating digital content, pay attention to typography and design. Consistent fonts and well-designed layouts enhance the overall aesthetic.
<br><br>
Nature and Natural Elements: Incorporate natural elements, plants, or outdoor scenes into your aesthetic. Nature-inspired aesthetics often evoke a sense of tranquility and beauty.
<br><br>
Personal Expression: Ultimately, your aesthetic is a form of self-expression. Choose elements that resonate with you personally, and don't be afraid to experiment and evolve over time.
<br><br>
Remember, there are no strict rules in being aestheticâ€”it's about expressing your individual style and preferences in a visually pleasing way. Explore different inspirations, find what resonates with you, and enjoy the creative process.</p>
